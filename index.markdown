## Holistic Design of Secure Systems on Capability Hardware (HD-Sec) 
HD-Sec is funded  by  the  Digital  Security  by  Design  (DSbD)  Programme delivered by UKRI
to support the DSbD ecosystem. DSbD means incorporating the treatment of cybersecurity threats,
 and protection against those threats, into the easiest stages of system design, so that 
 security is a fundamental design goal rather than an afterthought. 
The UK Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund (ISCF) challenge on Digital
Security by Design has a mission to increase the protection of IT systems against various class of 
software vulnerabilities, underpinned by additional hardware protection capabilities (so-called 
capability hardware). Our project will address engineering challenges in **establishing** and **formally verifying** 
the relationship between **application-level security requirements** and **secure software implementations** 
running on **capability hardware**. Our proposal is addressing Objective 1: *Capability enabled hardware 
proof and software verification* of the EPSRC/ISCF Digital Security by Design call.
